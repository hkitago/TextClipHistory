## Installation & Uninstallation

### Installation

To install the extension on iOS or iPadOS, go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Extensions, or enable the extension by toggling it on in the Manage Extensions option found in the Safari address bar.
For macOS, open Safari, go to Safari > Settings > Extensions, and enable the extension from there.

### Uninstallation

To uninstall the extension, similarly to the installation process, toggle the extension off, or remove it completely by selecting the extension icon on the Home Screen and choosing "Delete app".

## Usage

1. Load a web page.
2. Select the text within the web page and copy it. The extension also supports the 'Cut' and 'Copy link' command from the context menu.
3. Tap the icon next to the address bar and choose the extension.
4. A window will slide up from the bottom on iPhone, or a pop-up window will appear on iPad and Mac; select an item of text for pasting and click or tap it. If an input field (including textareas) is focused, the selected text will be inserted automatically.

> [!NOTE] 
> - Due to security concerns, the window will automatically close after 3 minutes of idle time while the popover is open, or immediately if the focus is lost.
> - If you enable the extension and it doesn't function correctly, please refresh the page, or close and restart Safari, and try again.
